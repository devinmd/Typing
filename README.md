### bugs
- if the post test info is displayed and use goes to settings then back to typing page the test info disappears and during test info shows
- ctr+a and deleting all text input doesn't send caret back to start, this is because the deleting text function goes by individual letters and not bulk\
- sometimes when test ends, sentence gets removed but post test info doesn't show and live info update loop doesn't stop
- caret appears on other pages due to there not being a check of which page you're on when moving/showing caret
- caret is flying around on typing page due to it moving when new tests are started
### todo
- post test info
	- add line breaks in the post test sentence display, will go off screen if it's a longer text
  - show errors in word list

	- fix footer positioning
  - save error word & letter lists and provide more information about them
	- rewrite error system
	- save stats in localstorage
